All of the files are named according to the book's listing ID number. They can then be copied as needed to the appropriate source file name. The above procedure will generate all of the listing files as TXT files having file names corresponding to the captions under each listing in this book. Each will have to be copied to “main.asm” as needed.  For example, the following command prompt generates the main.asm file used in the first demonstration in Chapter 2:

copy X64_Asm-master\Listing_2_1.txt main.asm

Warning: The assembler source code that appears in this book and is available for download is for learning to program in assembly language. Some of these programs are incomplete and even contain problems that need to be altered. No guarantee of their commercial utility is expressed or implied.
